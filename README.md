# Road-accidents-causes
This repository shows and analyzes factors that lead to road accidents
## Introduction
This project analyzes historical accident data to identify key factors influencing road safety in a metropolitan area. The analysis is performed using Weka's decision tree algorithm.
## Repository Structure
- data/: Contains the raw and preprocessed datasets.
- scripts/: Includes scripts for data preprocessing and Weka analysis.
- results/: Contains the decision tree image and performance metrics.
- screenshots/: Screenshots of key analysis stages.
- README.md: Instructions and project overview.
- report.pdf: Detailed report with methodology and insights.

## Instructions
1. *Data Preprocessing:*
   - Run data_preprocessing.py to clean and preprocess the dataset.
2. *Decision Tree Analysis:*
   - Load preprocessed_data.arff in Weka.
   - Train the J48 decision tree classifier.
   - Evaluate the model and analyze results.
3. *Viewing Results:*
   - Check the results/ directory for decision tree visualization and performance metrics.
   - Refer to the screenshots/ directory for images of key analysis stages.
